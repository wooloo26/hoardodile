/**
 * Drizzle Kit configuration for generating and applying SQLite migrations.
 *
 * - `schema` points at the barrel that re-exports every table definition
 *   so the generator sees the full schema graph.
 * - `out` is the folder Drizzle Kit writes / reads migrations from. The
 *   runtime migrator (see `src/infra/db/connection.ts`) reads the same
 *   folder at startup, so the two must agree.
 *
 * Schema-diff commands:
 *
 *   pnpm -F @hoardodile/server exec drizzle-kit generate
 *   pnpm -F @hoardodile/server exec drizzle-kit migrate   # standalone runner
 *
 * The app does NOT invoke `drizzle-kit migrate` at runtime -- it calls the
 * in-process `migrate()` from `drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3/migrator` to
 * avoid shipping the dev toolchain. See `src/infra/db/connection.ts`.
