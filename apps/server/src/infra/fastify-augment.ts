/**
 * Single source of truth for the {@link FastifyInstance} type surface.
 *
 * Centralising the Fastify augmentation here lets every consumer reach
 * the full surface with `import "src/infra/fastify-augment.ts"` (or
 * transitively via `src/domain/index.ts`).
 *
 * Decorations split into two layers:
 *
 * 1. **Infrastructure primitives** — env, db, paths, sessions, signals,
 *    probes, readOnly. Owned by Fastify plugins in `src/infra/plugins.ts`
 *    and `src/infra/probes/plugin.ts`. These are genuinely transport
 *    concerns: lifecycle, configuration, request-scoped helpers.
 * 2. **Service container** — the closure-based domain services. Owned
 *    by domain plugins via `buildServicePlugin`. These are pure DI
 *    targets, exposed on the Fastify instance only because tRPC and
 *    HTTP handlers run inside the Fastify request scope.
