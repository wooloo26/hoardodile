/**
 * Per-file ordered upload endpoints.
 *
 * POST /api/uploads/ordered
 *   Accepts multipart/form-data with a single `file` part. The server mints
 *   a fresh `fileId` (UUID), streams the file into the global staging pool,
 *   and returns `{ fileId }`. The client references this `fileId` later in
 *   an ordered list at resource creation; it may also delete the staged
 *   file via DELETE. There is no `uploadId` grouping — each file is
 *   independent, so adding / removing / reordering files never requires
 *   re-uploading bytes that have already been staged.
 *
 * DELETE /api/uploads/ordered/:fileId
 *   Removes a single staged file from the global pool. Returns 404 when
 *   `fileId` is not present.
