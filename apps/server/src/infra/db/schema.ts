// Each domain module owns its table definitions; this barrel re-exports
// them so `import * as schema from "./schema.ts"` in db/connection.ts picks
// up everything Drizzle needs, while domain code imports directly from the
// appropriate module (e.g. `"../resource/schema.ts"`). Migration bookkeeping
// lives in the Drizzle-Kit-managed `__drizzle_migrations` table.
